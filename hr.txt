Q what is the strength and weekness of you 
My strengths include being hardworking, having strong problem-solving abilities, and good time management skills.

One of my weaknesses is that I feel nervous when it comes to public speaking, and I’m still working on improving my communication skills. However, I’m actively trying to overcome this by taking small opportunities to speak in front of others. For example, when a teacher is absent, I volunteer to help my department head by taking junior classes. These experiences are helping me build confidence and become more comfortable speaking in front of groups.

Q How about this one: "Can you describe a challenging situation you faced and how you handled it?"
In a project where I was developing a chat application, I faced a problem with Socket.IO not connecting properly. Initially, I debugged the code and checked all functions to ensure they were correct. When I couldn’t resolve the issue, I consulted a senior and also searched online resources. I watched tutorials and reached out to a YouTuber who specializes in Socket.IO issues. Despite not finding an immediate solution from the online resources, I continued to analyze the code. After thoroughly debugging and testing, I eventually found a minor configuration error that was causing the issue. By fixing this, I was able to resolve the problem and ensure the application worked as expected. This experience taught me the value of persistence and utilizing multiple resources to solve complex problems.

Q Is there anything that's not mentioned in your resume ?
My father is a businessman, and growing up in that environment, I’ve learned how to stay calm under pressure and think practically. These skills really help me when I’m working on real-world projects—like debugging issues or solving problems in a team setting.
