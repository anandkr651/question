What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database system that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. Unlike standard relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a JSON document structure form. This makes it easy to operate with dynamic and unstructured data and MongoDB is an open-source and cross-platform database System.

Database
Database is a container for collections.
Each database gets its own set of files.
A single MongoDB server can has multiple databases.
 
Collection
Collection is a group of documents.
Collection is equivalent to RDBMS table.
A collection consist inside a single database.
Collections do not enforce a schema.
A Collection can have different fields within a Documents.

What is MongoDB, and How Does It Differ from Traditional SQL Databases?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database which means it does not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead of it uses a flexible and document-oriented data model that stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.
Unlike SQL databases that use rows and columns, MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents, making it easier to handle unstructured data and providing greater flexibility in terms of schema design.

What are Collections And Databases In MongoDB?
In MongoDB, a database is a container for collections, and a collection is a group of MongoDB documents. Collections are equivalent to tables in SQL databases, but they do not enforce a schema allowing for flexibility in the structure of the documents they contain. For example, you might have a users collection in a mydatabase database.

What are the Advantages of Using MongoDB Over Other Databases?
Flexibility: MongoDB's document-oriented model allows for dynamic schemas.
Scalability: Built-in sharding enables horizontal scaling.
High Availability: Replica sets provide redundancy and automatic failover.
Performance: Efficient storage and retrieval with BSON format.
Ease of Use: JSON-like documents make it easier for developers to interact with data

What are MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines and How are They Used?
The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation, modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into aggregated results.
Each stage performs an operation on the input documents and passes the results to the next stage.

Describe the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB
The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool for performing data processing and transformation on documents within a collection. It works by passing documents through a multi-stage pipeline, where each stage performs a specific operation on the data, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, reshaping and computing aggregations.

This framework is particularly useful for creating complex data transformations and analytics directly within the database.

what is the role of schema in mongoose? how do define it?
a schema in mongoose define the structure, validation, rules and behavior of MongoDB document, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
