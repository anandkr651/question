MySQL is a popular open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for database operations. While MySQL is a specific database system accessible for free and supports various programming languages.it was developed by Oracle Corporation.MySQL is widely used for various applications, from small websites to large-scale enterprise systems.

Difference Between MySQL and SQL

MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language).	
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used for communicating with relational databases.
MySQL is open source and accessible to any and everyone for free. 
It is not an open-source language.
MySQL supports basic programming languages like C, C++, Python, Ruby, etc.
SQL is in itself a Query language used for database systems.
MySQL available only in the English language.
SQL is available in different languages.
MySQL doesn’t support user-defined functions and XML.
SQL supports user-defined functions and XML.

What is MySQL and How does it differ from other relational databases?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for managing structured data. It utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data. MySQL is known for its reliability, scalability, and performance, making it a popular choice for various applications.MySQL and PostgreSQL both are open source but Oracle and MS SQL Server is not open source. 

3306 is MySQL server‘s default port.

Explain the difference between having and where clause in MySQL.
WHERE statement is used to filter rows but HAVING statement is used to filter groups.
GROUP BY is not used with WHERE. HAVING clause is used with GROUP BY.

What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in MySQL?
DELETE Command is used to delete rows from the table depending on given the condition. TRUNCATE command is used to DELETE all rows from the table. DELETE command is a Data Manipulation Language command. TRUNCATE command is a Data Definition Language command.

What is a view? How to create a view?
A database object that has no value is called view. Rows and columns exist in a view. A view is virtual table. it is created by combining one or more tables. The difference of a view and a table is that views are definition that build on other tables. If the underlying table changes, the View will also reflect those same changes.


What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database system that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. Unlike standard relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a JSON document structure form. This makes it easy to operate with dynamic and unstructured data and MongoDB is an open-source and cross-platform database System.

Database
Database is a container for collections.
Each database gets its own set of files.
A single MongoDB server can has multiple databases.
 
Collection
Collection is a group of documents.
Collection is equivalent to RDBMS table.
A collection consist inside a single database.
Collections do not enforce a schema.
A Collection can have different fields within a Documents.


1. What is MongoDB, and How Does It Differ from Traditional SQL Databases?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database which means it does not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead of it uses a flexible and document-oriented data model that stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.
Unlike SQL databases that use rows and columns, MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents, making it easier to handle unstructured data and providing greater flexibility in terms of schema design.

What are Collections And Databases In MongoDB?
In MongoDB, a database is a container for collections, and a collection is a group of MongoDB documents. Collections are equivalent to tables in SQL databases, but they do not enforce a schema allowing for flexibility in the structure of the documents they contain. For example, you might have a users collection in a mydatabase database.

What are the Advantages of Using MongoDB Over Other Databases?
Flexibility: MongoDB's document-oriented model allows for dynamic schemas.
Scalability: Built-in sharding enables horizontal scaling.
High Availability: Replica sets provide redundancy and automatic failover.
Performance: Efficient storage and retrieval with BSON format.
Ease of Use: JSON-like documents make it easier for developers to interact with data

What are MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines and How are They Used?
The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation, modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into aggregated results.
Each stage performs an operation on the input documents and passes the results to the next stage.

Describe the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB
The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool for performing data processing and transformation on documents within a collection. It works by passing documents through a multi-stage pipeline, where each stage performs a specific operation on the data, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, reshaping and computing aggregations.

This framework is particularly useful for creating complex data transformations and analytics directly within the database.

A schema is a blueprint that defines how data is organized, structured, and accessed. It's a framework for managing data effectively. 

What does a schema include? 
Table names: The names of tables in the database
Fields: The names of fields in the database
Data types: The types of data in the database
Relationships: How tables relate to each other
Constraints: The rules that apply to maintain data integrity

It divides the database into three different levels: Internal Schema (Physical Level) Conceptual Schema (Logical Level) External Schema (View Level)

A physical schema defines how data is stored in the storage system, including the arrangement of files, indices and other storage structures. It specifies the actual code and syntax needed to create the database structure. Essentially, it determines where and how the data is stored in the physical storage medium.

A logical schema defines the logical structure of the data, including tables, views, relationships, and integrity constraints. It describes how data is organized in tables and how the attributes of these tables are connected. The logical schema ensures that the data is stored in an organized manner, while maintaining data integrity.
Using Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, the logical schema outlines the relationships between different data components. It also defines integrity constraints to ensure the quality of data during insertion and updates.

The view schema is the highest level of abstraction in a database, focusing on how users interact with the database. It defines the interface through which users can access and manipulate data, without needing to understand the underlying storage mechanisms.
A database can have multiple view schemas, also known as subschemas, each providing a different perspective of the data. These schemas describe only a part of the database.

A Data Model is the concept of tools that are developed to summarize the description of the database. Data Models provide us with a transparent picture of data which helps us in creating an actual database. It shows us from the design of the data to its proper implementation of data.
